We are supposed to be employees of Netflix.So, Netflix is thinking to add a new feature to reproduction of movies and videos.
They want the user to have the ability to convert a grayscale movie to a colorized one. A video, as it is logical, is a production of
a lot of images. So, Netflix created this project and build a team in order to make it happen. Netflix ended up to add this feature to
the options of the user after several searches and questions they have made to the users.

The first dataset we used was from “MIT places” and contained pictures of various themes such as places, people, dogs. We observed that 
although we had good results for the places we have bad results for the dogs. We add in our dataset a part of dataset of dogs’ pictures 
that we found in “standford vision” and we saw that the results we improved a lot.

The model we are going to use is a convolutional neural network model. We will use Python as the main programming language of this 
assignment. Of course it is necessary to use a appropriate library in order to implement this algorithm. For our model we will use PyTorch.
